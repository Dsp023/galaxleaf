# Color Theory

## The Color Wheel
-   **Primary:** Red, Yellow, Blue.
-   **Secondary:** Green, Orange, Purple.
-   **Tertiary:** Mix of primary and secondary.

## Color Harmony
Formulas for picking colors that look good together.
1.  **Monochromatic:** Different shades (lightness) of a single hue. Clean and modern.
2.  **Analogous:** Colors next to each other on the wheel (e.g., Blue, Blue-Green, Green). Calming.
3.  **Complementary:** Opposites on the wheel (Red & Green). High contrast, energetic.

## HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)
The preferred model for digital design (vs RGB or Hex).
-   **Hue:** The color type (0-360 degrees).
-   **Saturation:** Intensity (0% gray, 100% vibrant).
-   **Lightness:** Brightness (0% black, 100% white).
*Tip:* To make a balanced palette, keep Hue varied but Saturation/Lightness consistent.

## The 60-30-10 Rule
A decorating rule applied to UI:
-   **60%** Primary/Background color (Neutral).
-   **30%** Secondary color (Support/Brand).
-   **10%** Accent color (CTAs, buttons).
