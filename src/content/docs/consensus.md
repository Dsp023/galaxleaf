# Consensus Mechanisms

## Proof of Work (PoW)
Used by **Bitcoin**.
-   **Concept:** Nodes (Miners) compete to solve a difficult mathematical puzzle. The first to solve it gets to add the block and earn a reward.
-   **Pros:** Extremely secure. Proven track record.
-   **Cons:** Massive energy consumption. Slow throughput (TPS).

## Proof of Stake (PoS)
Used by **Ethereum** (post-merge), Solana, Cardano.
-   **Concept:** Validators "stake" (lock up) their own coins as collateral. The network randomly chooses a validator to create the next block based on how much they staked.
-   **Pros:** Energy efficient (99.9% less than PoW). faster.
-   **Cons:** "Rich get richer" centralization risk.

## Other Types
-   **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):** Users vote for delegates to validate blocks. (Faster, more centralized).
-   **Proof of History (PoH):** Solana's cryptographic clock to speed up consensus.
