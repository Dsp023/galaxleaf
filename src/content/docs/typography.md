# Typography

## Hierarchy
The most important principle. Guiding the user's eye through the content using size, weight, and color.
1.  **H1:** The main headline. Biggest, boldest. (Only one per page).
2.  **H2/H3:** Section headers.
3.  **Body:** The actual text. optimized for long-form reading.

## Typefaces vs Fonts
-   **Serif (Times New Roman):** Has little "feet" on letters. Traditional, formal.
-   **Sans-Serif (Inter, Helvetica):** No feet. Clean, modern, digital-first.
-   **Monospace (Courier):** Every letter is same width. Used for code.

## Key Metrics
-   **Line Height (Leading):** Space between lines. Essential for readability. Standard is 1.5x font size for body text.
-   **Letter Spacing (Tracking):** Space between characters. Capitals often need more tracking to look elegant.
-   **Measure:** The length of a line of text. Optimum is 45-75 characters. Too long, and the eye loses its place.
