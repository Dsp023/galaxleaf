# User Centered Design (UCD)

## Overview
**UCD** is an iterative design process where user needs are the focus at every stage. It fights the urge to design based on "what looks cool" or "what the developer wants to build."

## The Process
1.  **Empathize:** Research users. Surveys, interviews, analytics. Create **Personas** (fictional characters representing user types).
2.  **Define:** State the core problem clearly.
3.  **Ideate:** Brainstorm solutions. Wireframing, sketching.
4.  **Prototype:** Build a low-fidelity or high-fidelity mockup (Figma).
5.  **Test:** Put the prototype in front of real people. Watch them struggle. **Don't help them.**
6.  **Iterate:** Fix the issues found in testing.

## Heuristics (Nielsen)
Rules of thumb for good UX:
-   **Visibility of System Status:** Loaders, toasts. "I know what's happening."
-   **Match between System and Real World:** Trash can icon for delete.
-   **User Control:** Undo/Redo.
-   **Consistency:** Buttons should look the same on every page.
