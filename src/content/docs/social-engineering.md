# Social Engineering

## Overview
Social Engineering is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information. It targets the weakest link in any security system: **The Human**.

## Types
1.  **Phishing:** Generic fake emails ("Reset your Netflix password") leading to fake login sites.
2.  **Spear Phishing:** Highly targeted attacks. "Hi Bob, I noticed you're working on the Project X finance report. Please review this attachment." (Uses LinkedIn/Public info to sound real).
3.  **Pretexting:** Creating a scenario. "Hi, I'm from IT support. We detect a virus on your machine. I need your password to fix it."
4.  **Baiting:** Leaving a USB drive labeled "Executive Salaries 2024" in the parking lot. Curiosity kills the cat.

## Defense
-   **Security Training:** Teach employees never to share credentials.
-   **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Even if the attacker gets the password, they can't get past the 2FA code (hopefully).
